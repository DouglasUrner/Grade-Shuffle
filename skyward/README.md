## Importing Scores

Scores are imported through the Gradebook using one of two mechanisms, both are accessed by hovering over the **Assignments** tab in your gradebook:

* **Assignments > Import Assignment Scores:** allows the import of scores (only, no codes or flags) from a single assignment with a relatively simple import format.
* **Assignments > Advanced Export/Import Assignments:** allows the import of scores for multiple assignments along with flags and codes. The format is a bit messier. You can export existing scores (if any) in a template.
